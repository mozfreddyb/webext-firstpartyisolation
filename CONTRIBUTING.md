# Contributing to First Party Isolation 

## Localization & Translations
These are the steps if you want to contribute messages for a new language:
- Figure out short name for your language (e.g., `es`)
- copy directory `en` into the directory with the short name (e.g., `es`)
- modify the `message` fields in `messages.json`, but leave the descriptions intact
- file a pull request with the new folder and modified messages.json file
- Done!
